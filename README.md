# Solid Principles For C# Developers (By Steve Smith aka Ardalis on PluralSight)
This is the branch in which SRP, OCP and LSP were already applied, but in addition to that some fat interfaces have been added after https://github.com/Tejas1202/SolidPrinciplesForCSharpDevelopers/tree/master-upto-SOL-principlesonly branch.
So in short, this branch just depicts how ISP is been violated and the fix for it will be in the main https://github.com/Tejas1202/SolidPrinciplesForCSharpDevelopers/tree/master branch
