# Solid Principles For C# Developers (By Steve Smith aka Ardalis on PluralSight)
It's easy to write software that fulfills its users' immediate needs, but is difficult to extend and maintain. 
Such software becomes a burden for companies striving to remain competitive. 
In this course, SOLID Principles for C# Developers, you will learn five fundamental principles of object-oriented design that will keep your software loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable.

- First, you will see how to keep classes small and focused, and how to extend their behavior without having to edit their source code. 
- Then, you will discover the importance of properly designing interfaces and abstractions in your systems. 
- Finally, you will explore how to arrange dependencies in your system so different implementations can be added or plugged in as needed, allowing a truly modular design. 

When you are finished with this course, you will understand how to build maintainable, extensible, and testable applications using C# and .NET.
