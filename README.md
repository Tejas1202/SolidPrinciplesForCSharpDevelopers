# Solid Principles For C# Developers
(The first three modules of the course: SRP, OCP and LSP)
This is the first branch in which we just fixed the original code (i.e devoid of following any principles which you can find in WithoutSolidPriciples folder) and applied SRP, OCP and LSP (in WithSolidPriciples folder)
After this, you should go to the branch https://github.com/Tejas1202/SolidPrinciplesForCSharpDevelopers/tree/master-upto-SOL-before-applying-ISP in which there are some fat interfaces added to depict how ISP is violated
